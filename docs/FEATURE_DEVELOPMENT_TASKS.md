# Feature-Driven Development Implementation Tasks

## Overview

Changed from traditional component-based development to **Feature-based** development approach. Each feature operates independently and provides incremental value during implementation.

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Working Software First**: Prioritize functioning features
2. **Incremental Value**: Provide value in each iteration
3. **User-Centric**: Feature design centered on user experience
4. **Testable Features**: Each feature is independently testable

### Development Flow
```
Simplest Working Feature → Add Enhancement → Add Enhancement → ...
       ↓                         ↓                 ↓
   Test & Ship              Test & Ship      Test & Ship
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Principles

#### 1. Feature-First Thinking
```typescript
// ❌ Component-first approach
class JsonViewer extends Component { ... }
class FilterInput extends Component { ... }
class StatusBar extends Component { ... }

// ✅ Feature-first approach
function BasicJsonDisplay(data: JsonValue): JSX.Element { ... }
function SimpleNavigation(data: JsonValue): JSX.Element { ... }
function BasicFiltering(data: JsonValue, filter: string): JSX.Element { ... }
```

#### 2. Incremental Integration
```typescript
// Each feature builds on previous ones
const F1_BasicDisplay = (data) => renderJson(data);
const F2_WithNavigation = (data) => addNavigation(F1_BasicDisplay(data));
const F3_WithFiltering = (data, filter) => addFiltering(F2_WithNavigation(data), filter);
```

#### 3. Test-Driven Feature Development
```typescript
// Feature tests before implementation
describe('Feature: Basic JSON Display', () => {
  describe('User can view JSON data', () => {
    it('should display simple objects correctly', () => { ... });
    it('should handle arrays appropriately', () => { ... });
    it('should show error messages for invalid JSON', () => { ... });
  });
});
```

### Quality Gates

- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to defined acceptance criteria
- **Quality Compromise**: Non-negotiable quality gates
- **Timeline Pressure**: Prioritize core functionality over nice-to-have features

4. **Quality Improvement**: Thorough testing and validation by feature
5. **Team Efficiency**: Independence enabling parallel development

This approach enables more reliable and valuable software development.
